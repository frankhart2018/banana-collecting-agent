# Report of training the agent

<p>The model was trained for a maximum of 2,000 episodes but the agent was able to solve the environment (i.e. get atleast +13 average score over 100 adjacent episodes).</p>

## Model

<p>The model is called a Deep Q-Network which was first discovered by the DeepMind team. This uses a Deep Neural Network (or a Multi Layered Perceptron) for estimating the action-value function (Q<sub>Ï€</sub>).</p>
